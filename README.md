# SocialNetworkAPI

## Description 
The Social Network API is an app that focuses on MongoDB, Mongoose and Express for testing server routes. With the MVC in mind, you can create users, have thoughts on users posts, and react to thoughts. You will be able to update and delete users and thoughts. The use of Insomnia Core will help visualize testing routes and making requests to the server. There will also be virtuals as to friend counts and reaction counts.

## Usage 
To start the server in your command line when you are in the root directory, type "node server" or "node server.js". Then open Insomnia Core and test the routes with the Local Host url and appropriate endpoints.
